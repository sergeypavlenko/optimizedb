DESCRIPTION
-----------
One of known issue Drupal sites is table cache_form overgrowth (see issue
https://drupal.org/node/1506196). This table stores filled forms in cache_form
table but it did not clear while running cron tasks, so size of this table could
be much more greater than other tables in database, which could cause lack of
disc space on hosting server


OptimizeDB module clears outdated records in cache_form table during cron task
run in safe mode. You could clean cache_form table from admin area too

The module "OptimizeDB" is also able to optimize selected database tables and
display their sizes on demand. Automatic optimizing of tables during cron tasks
is not available because it may cause problems with the database and crash
tables. However, you can configure the notification about need of table
optimization.

If your server have often  problems with the database server, make a backup of
the database before optimization run. The danger of losing data using module for
 optimization the same as while using PHPMyAdmin.

Module OptimizeDB provide such features:
1. Ability to clean cache_from in administrative page or do it by cron.
2. Ability to optimize all databaseâ€™s tables and display its sizes.
3. Configuration of notification about necessity to perform maintenance tasks.
4. Perform check and repair operation with tables.
5. Prevent crashing tables when perform all maintained actions.

Additional features:
1. Work with MySQL and PgSQL
2. Execute operations with Drush
